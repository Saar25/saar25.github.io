                I'm a passionate and experienced Full-Stack Developer with hands-on expertise in building and
                maintaining large-scale projects â€” both frontend and backend. I enjoy working across the stack and
                thrive on solving complex problems with clean, efficient code.

            <span className={styles['my-intro-label-info']}>
                I bring strong technical and interpersonal skills to the table. I'm a fast learner and creative
                problem-solver, able to build complete systems quickly and at high quality. I also specialize in
                optimizing, maintaining, and elevating existing platforms to production-ready standards.

            <span className={styles['my-intro-label-info']}>
                Beyond full-stack development, I'm deeply interested in 3D graphics, game development, low-level
                systems, and software architecture. You can explore some of my projects on my GitHub page.
